**Think and build** of multiple automation solutions for a Cloud Provider company:

* Design and development of complex automation solutions to provide:
  * additional customer self-service solutions (quota management, security services…)
  * backend systems automation (automated backup policies, observability…)
* Multiple kind of automation services provided to end-users through:
  * VMware Cloud Director + extensibility
  * VMware vRealize Automation + extensibility
  * Many other REST API endpoints
* Design of a new automation stack (K8s, FaaS, Argo workflow)
