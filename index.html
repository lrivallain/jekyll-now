  <h1>vUptime.io, the migration process</h1>

  <p>This post will explain a new migration : the <a href="http://vuptime.io">vuptime.io</a> one.</p>
  <p>If you don't already know vUptime, it's absolutely normal ! I decided a few days ago, to move all articles from this blog to a new one name vUptime.io.</p>

  <p class="vuptimelogo">
    <img src="/images/darkbg_200px.png" alt="vUptime.io Logo" />
  </p>

  <p>What does it mean ?</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://vuptime.io">vUptime.io</a> will be my new place to share technical posts with the VMware and Cloud Computing communities.</li>
    <li>The current domain (<a href="https://lri.ovh">lri.ovh</a>) will remain online to host a resume and redirections from old posts URL to new ones.</li>
    <li>By splitting both personal and technical blogs, I also hope to host blog posts from other people in a close future.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There is still some work in progress to complete the migration, like adding HTTPS access, but if you whant to update your RSS feed, the new one will be: <a href="http://vuptime.io/feed.xml">RSS</a>.</p>
  <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
