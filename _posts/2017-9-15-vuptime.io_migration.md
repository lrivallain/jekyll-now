This post will explain a new migration : the [vuptime.io](http://vuptime.io) one.

If you don't already know vUptime, it's absolutely normal ! I decided a few days ago, to move all technical posts from this blog to a new one named **vUptime.io**.

What does it mean ?
* [vUptime.io](http://vuptime.io) will be my new place to share technical posts with the VMware and Cloud Computing communities.
* The current domain ([lri.ovh](https://lri.ovh)) will remain online to host a resume and redirections from old posts URL to new ones.
* By splitting both personal and technical blogs, I also hope to host blog posts from other people in a close future.

There is still some work in progress to complete the migration, like adding HTTPS access, but if you whant to update your RSS feed, the new one will be: [RSS](http://vuptime.io/feed.xml).

Thank you for reading.
