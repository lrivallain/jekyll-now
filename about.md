Sys Admin in IT Consulting, I work mainly on VMware virtual infrastructures, "IaaS/SaaS/PaaS" and cloud computing offers for key accounts (architecture, orchestration, disaster recovery plans, trainings...).

A bit of laziness encourage me to write a lot of **#Python** or **#PowerShell** scripts to operate.

### Open source

I'm also self-interested in open-source solutions like **#Docker**, **#OpenShift** or **#Django**.

### Old version of the blog

An old version of this blog is available on OpenShift plateform : [blog-lrivallain.rhcloud.com](http://blog-lrivallain.rhcloud.com)
